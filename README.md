# AWS
#### This repo shares the exploration done by me so far in AWS CLI for day to day requirements.
I have put the unsolved requirements as well in the todo file above.

*In order to make better of potential out of cli, awscli should be installed first.*

#### Getting started with it.

Use this command to configure the suitable IAM keys, the default way.
### aws configure

For you want multiple keys to configure in same environment, keys can be given some name like 'ops' given below.
### aws configure --profile ops



#### Please note: All the features change shape time to time and with updates some commands might not work as expected by the time you read this.
