S3 mentions every data to be uploaded as an object.
Those objects can be uploaded to S3, copied from one S3 to another and can be download as well on requirement.

Onboard by configuring aws cli credentials first, and then begin!


## Start by listing all the existing S3 buckets.
aws s3 ls

## little extension to the previous command shows all the files/directories present inside the bucket.
aws s3 ls s3://test-bucket

## copying objects to & fro.
## With bucket and local storage in picture, the number of permutations comeout as four, and we will address each one of them.

aws s3 cp <path-to-sourceobj> <target-path>

Case 1: aws s3 cp s3://test-bucket .   // download the content from S3 to local.

Case 2: aws s3 cp . s3://test-bucket   // upload the content from local to S3.

Case 3: aws s3 cp s3://test-bucket s3://new-bucket   // copies the content from one S3 to another.

Case 4: aws s3 cp . .   // which really does not make any sense so just leave this one.



### Addons

## Use --summarize for sizing the bucket/object-directories
aws s3 ls s3://test-bucket  --summarize | tail -3

## For getting two different S3 buckets on same page, use sync
aws s3 sync      s3://test-bucket  s3://new-bucket

## try --human-readable
